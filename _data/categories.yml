      summary: "We typically use Amazon Web Services, Google App Engine, or Digital Ocean depending on client requirements. Most of the time we use a mixture of both to eliminate single points of failure. We like these services because they are easy to scale as your requirements grow. Redundant storage engines like Amazon's S3 store your files in 3 separate geographic locations. Good luck losing that file."
