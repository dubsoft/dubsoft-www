    <p>Tempus is a time tracker that is changing the way people track time.
    The idea is to leverage the power of data, intelligent scripts and
    programs, and natural language processing to track/record/export time
    with minimal effort.</p>

    <p>Tempus is an alpha product and is always looking for
    user/potential user input. Head on over to <a
