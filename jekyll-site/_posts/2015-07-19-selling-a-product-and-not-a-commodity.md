I was hesitant to sell more than a website, mobile app, or technical commodity. As a technician, how could I sell anymore?

The answer is I cannot.

To sell a product, I had to stop thinking like a technician.

A product gives my customer a feeling. A  good feeling like trust, assurance, or happiness.

What is a product?

A product leaves my customer with a feeling. Yes, they walk away with a website, mobile app, or technical commodity. But always with a feeling.

The product is _gold_. Built with the sames components as steel and iron, but provides a good feeling.

So what makes a product gold instead of steel?
